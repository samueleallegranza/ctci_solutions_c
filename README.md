# C solutions of CTCI book
#### _Cracking the Coding Interview_

This repository contains all my personal solutions, written in **C language**, of many of the exercises contained in _Cracking the Coding Interview_ (CTCI) book.

My solutions could be similar to the ones suggested by the author, but in some cases they could differ a little, as I could have approached a different, but still efficent, path to solve the same problem.

I hope that you will find these resources useful for your practice :)
